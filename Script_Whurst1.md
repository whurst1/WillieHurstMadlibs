Lucy pushed the <door> open, which immediately set off a <bell> somewhere in the back of the shop. 
She pushed in and almost immediately collided with a tall <man> her own size. 
It started to wobble but she managed to stabilize it before it <falls> over.


They <dance> around the shop. It was actually quite <werid>, and remarkably long. 
In fact, the <color> of the shop disappeared way into the <shop>. 
The shop was crammed with all sorts of <crazy>-looking items. Tall urns. Clocks. 
Decorations of all types. Items of furniture. 
Shelves of dishes, pots and bowls. <yellow> seats and couches. It went on and on.
